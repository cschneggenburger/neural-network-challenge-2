UNC Chapel Hill AI Bootcamp Module 19 Challenge

# Background
You are tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. Additionally, HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so you are also asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. These two columns should be predicted using a branched neural network.

# Files
The attrition jupyter notebook starter code was provided and then expanded upon by myself.

# Functions/Dependencies
- from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
- from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
- from pandas as pd
- from numpy as np
- from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
- from tesnorflow.keras import layers

# Analysis
My answers and analysis to the model can be found in the attrition jupyter notebook file in this repo.
